# extra_tree_games_category

A machine learning project with the extra tree algorithm and aiming to perform a classifier to determine games category based in his content. 

Data visualization with Pandas and Seaborn, create model with Sklearn and deployment with Flask. I tried to oversampling the data with SMOTE() and scale the data using StandardScale(), but I had the best results without using either of these two types of preprocessing.

The final accuracy is 85%.
